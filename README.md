Model2roms is a Python toolbox for creating the necessary climatology, boundary, and initial forcing files 
required to run the ROMS (<a href="http://myroms.org/" target="_blank">Regional Ocean Modeling System</a>) model. The latest version of model2roms can convert several popular model hindcasts and projections including the NORESM (Norways Earth System Model), SODA global re-analysis, HYCOM, World Ocean Atlas (WOA), and GLORYS (Mercator Ocean) to a use as forcing files for a given ROMS grid structure.

More detailed information on how to use and install is available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/trondkr/model2roms/wiki/Introduction-to-model2roms)
